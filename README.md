Intro to Git

YOYO I am an Astrophyics graduate currently working in Trader Support. The time I enjoyed the most at uni was the programming! I completed a 10 week Java course and later wrote the bulk of my masters in IDL. I'm starting on Git because it seems to be an essential tool for anone who wants to work in programming, and an easy way to show off my projects.
